A Infinite Photo Feed 

The main code is in App.js and CSS is in sai.css
Loader.js has a  loader imported from loading.io

I have installed React-Infinte-Scroll Component,Framer-Motion and react-icons.

In App.js render function we are mainly doing 2 things: Infinite Scroll and popping up a Modal when image is clicked.

React-Infinite-Scroll Component will handle the Infinite Scroll for us.
Popping up Modal can be achieved by setting react state for selectedImage to url.

I have also added Framer Motion animation in Pop-up Modal.
